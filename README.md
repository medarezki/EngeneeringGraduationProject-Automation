This project is about Automating Air Handling systems and HVAC regulations in a sensitive medical erea.

Abstract

The sensitivity of the advanced medical biosphere depends on atmospheres controlled in real time to allow the vitality of candidates for complex interventions where the organism could be exposed to contact with germs from the external environment, but also for environments of high sensitivity with physical realities requiring appropriate air treatment and their cooling as a result of the reactive heat they emit, such as particle accelerators producing radioactive isotopes used in nuclear medicine.
  The use of air in the treatment of environments is carried out by studies related to HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning), a field concerned with the approaches of GTC (Management of Centralized Techniques) which offers studies including the downstream is to provide an air environment of the required quality, external infiltration rejection systems risking contamination, and hydraulic cooling of active systems. This is possible thanks to an energy cluster comprising air treatment units. These organs, forming a candidate system to maintain pressure, temperature and humidity performance by control laws implemented and uploaded in a PLC, including the programs of decoupling of the influences which are encapsulated thanks to the internal complexity of the system giving him refuge.
  The theoretical and empirical emergence of the automatic in this case therefore adds the performance bias. Its range of instructions forming a conditioning pattern which must be subject to a response whose trajectory is to ensure a protective, sensitive and precise environment thanks to the programs which dictate the control laws and the regulation references.

  What would be the optimal approach to automation that will meet the satisfaction of the instructions by supervising the HVAC installations? and what is the contribution of the CGV in the management of these?
  Is it possible to dissociate in practice the internal couplings of the system by partial regulations at the monovariable scale?
  And what are the software and hardware configurations that contribute to the solution of the problem?

  The project will respond to these questions by creating an industrial supervision system, geared towards medical home automation.
  Project that will take a Cyclotron room at the Chahids Mahmoudi Hospital candidate for the test of the theme, a study that will be put into practice by an installation of Siemens products (Desigo PXTM), a software configuration aimed at regulation and decoupling of influences in HVAC models. The GTC contributes to the supervision by a programmed HMI which will bring an obedience by the operators ensuring the air quality, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the automated HVAC systems to the cooling of the system, including to ensure the quality of the air, the mitigation of the risks of external contamination, and the maintenance of nuclear filtering in real time.
